# AudioTools
 a small unity project testing and creating audio tools

 This project was made to test different audio tools and implementations in unity. 

So far there are a few main features implemented
- Patches with randomized oneshot sounds
- Audio settings objects allowing users to easily set up audio source pre sets.
- An audio manager that manages a pool of audio sources and allows easy playing of oneshot patches in a more performant manner.
- A footstep helper that also has a material helper, allowing users to map materials to patches for footsteps.
